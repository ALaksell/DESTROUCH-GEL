# DESTROUCH GEL E-commerce Website

**Core Features:**

*   **Product Information:** Detailed descriptions, technical specifications, and usage instructions.
*   **Interactive Sections:** FAQ accordion for common questions.
*   **Order Form:** Simple form for customer details and order placement.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Toggle between English and Arabic content.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile.
*   **Subtle Animations:** Enhances user experience with smooth transitions and visual feedback.

*   **CSS3:** Styles the website, including responsive layouts and subtle animations for an improved user experience.
*   **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity, such as the navigation toggle, FAQ accordion, and language switching functionality.
*   **Google Fonts:** Used for custom typography.
